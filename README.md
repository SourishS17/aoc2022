# Advent of Code 2022
Hi there! I hope you are enjoying AoC 2022 so far :D

These are just my personal, raw, authentic solutions. I've done them recorded and timed, but not at release time (which is 5am here!)

`Xin.txt` --> my input<br>
`Xpin.txt` --> example input (some days only)<br>
`dayXa.py` --> my part 1 solution<br>
`dayXb.py` --> my part 2 solution<br>

And my accompanying videos (impressions, timelapse, explanation) are [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBODEqHSvpFLujjuEkpvKBAJLcaLQNUmw).
